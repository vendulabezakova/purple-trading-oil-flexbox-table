# purple-trading-oil-flexbox-table

I coded this table according to the graphic. First, I used bootstrap-grid but in this case I wasn't able to give a box shadow to right column so I changed it to a flexbox. On mobile devices it worksa as a table - by slide to side. :-) I'll put link after I publish page which I'm preparing.
